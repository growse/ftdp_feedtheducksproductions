<h2>Current Productions</h2>
<p>Feed The Ducks Productions currently has two show in production, hopefully for the Edinburgh Fringe 2008:<br>
(Click on the musical title to link you to its website.)</p>
<br><h2><a href = "http://www.apocalypse-the-musical.com"><img src="images/apoc.JPG"></a></h2>
<p>Misguided but well-meaning nuns, cows, angels and cookies take their part on the cosmic stage in this classic tale of milkman-meets-whore, set against the backdrop of the end of the world.

<i><strong>Apocalypse: The Musical</strong></i> bounds through the surreal and the sublime, taking a pit-stop now and again to indulge in some lyrical gaiety which Tom Lehrer would be proud of: a veritable picnic of playfulness and punch. We'll treat you to some of the finest gospel-funk-tinged-musical-theatre-folk-parody-soul-rock music to grace a stage this year, whilst tackling the end of creation as we know it.

With miracles, mayhem, misuse of an ironing-board and the best udder-choreography you may ever see, <i><strong>Apocalypse: The Musical</strong></i> is far too fun to miss.

<p>Things aren't going so well for Joey. One of his old school friends has got him embroiled in stuffing the deceased pets of a rather serious looking lady with a gun, he's almost certainly tangled up in something illegal and his wife is sleeping with his accountant, who has delusions of being a hitman and taking Joey out of the picture. It seems the ideal time to check into <i><strong>HappyLand</strong></i>, the residential therapy camp that's taking the media by storm. Fliers, adverts, tv slots, chat shows- everyone seems to be talking about the wonder camp for the stressed and depressed. For just a modest monthly fee, your therapy will be personally supervised by a <i><strong>HappyLand</strong></i> counsellor, with bands of Smileys to make sure your every need is cared for, within the sanctuary of rolling fields and high-security perimeter fences. It's the perfect escape, the perfect solution to any problem, and a lot of people seem to be checking in... but do you know anyone who has checked out?</P>
