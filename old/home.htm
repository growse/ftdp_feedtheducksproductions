<h2>About Us</h2><br>
<p>Feed The Ducks Productions was founded in early 2005 when several students, predominantly from Cambridge University and all with Fringe experience, came together with the aim of producing new comedy musicals.  Their first production was Newton and Merry's <i><strong>Apocalypse: The Musical</strong></i>, originally performed at the Fitzpatrick Hall, Cambridge University.  This show later appeared at the Fringe in C+1, C-Venue, to critical acclaim.  In early 2007 Feed The Ducks Productions formed as Limited Company.  Later that year Newton and Merry began work on their second Feed the Ducks show, <i><strong>HappyLand</i></strong>, which was showcased at Goldsmith's College in October 2007.  As with <i><strong>Apocalypse: The Musical</strong></i>, <i><strong>HappyLand</i></strong> continued Feed The Ducks' tradition of off-beat content in an up-beat context, making for a fun and quirky musical comedy. Feed The Ducks is now hoping to bring these two musicals to the Fringe for summer 2008. </p>
